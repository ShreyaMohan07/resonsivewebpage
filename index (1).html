                    <p>Java is a high-level,class-based,It is a object-oriented programming language that is designed
                        to have as few implementation dependenciesas possible.It is a general-purpose programming
                        language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere[WORA],meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                        Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

                        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                        A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be
                        related to each other;these relations help structure the data.SQL is a language programmers use
                        to create,modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the
                        database.</p>
